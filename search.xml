Header information is incorrect"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>1. Header information is incorrect</font></h4><p>Just as we struggled with whether or not to embrace Swift, are many people today struggling with whether or not to embrace SwiftUI. Then I can tell you very clearly that if you choose to embrace Swift, then SwiftUI is a hurdle you won’t be able to get past sooner or later! Take my advice, it’s not too late to embrace SwiftUI, you’ll find more and more hiring JD’s asking for SwiftUI. I’ve also been learning SwiftUI on my own lately, and I’m going to be writing a series of posts about SwiftUI, so let’s start with this one on SwiftUI vs UIKit and why we’re going to go with SwiftUI.</p><h4 id="2-UIKit"><a href="#2-UIKit" class="headerlink" title="2. UIKit"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>2. UIKit</font></h4><p>UIKit was publicly released in 2008 and is built on the object-oriented Objective-C language. In UIKit, all views inherit from a class called UIView, which has a very large number of properties and methods-such as background, layout, layers for rendering, and so on-there are almost 200 properties, and every UIView and subclass of UIView, whether you want it or not, will have Every UIView and subclass of UIView will have these properties whether you want them or not. </p><p>For example, there is a special UIStackView in UIKit, which is a view type that will not be rendered for the design intent of making layouts simpler. But because of the inheritance mechanism, even though it doesn’t render, it has those various unused properties including background color. </p><p>So, in UIKit, when we draw a UI that contains a series of labels&#x2F;buttons, etc., it’s a stack of “big” and “heavy” Views that contain more than 200 attributes.</p><h4 id="3-SwiftUI"><a href="#3-SwiftUI" class="headerlink" title="3. SwiftUI"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>3. SwiftUI</font></h4><p>Born in 2019, SwiftUI is a modern framework for building user interfaces introduced by Apple. As new devices evolve in terms of processing power, graphics performance, and other technical features, SwiftUI takes full advantage of these new hardware and technical capabilities, optimizing and tuning the underlying implementation so that apps running on new devices can render interfaces, handle user interactions, and deliver smoother animations and effects more efficiently.</p><p>SwiftUI is based on responsive programming approach to UI development, all the views are fine-grained structure struct, compared struct and class can be known, Swift is very much advocate the use of struct, the specific why will not expand.  In SwiftUI, each view is a lightweight struct structure, which abandons UIKit’s inheritance approach and uses protocols to contain the few properties and modifiers needed. All in all, SwiftUI is much more performant and faster than UIKit, with less overhead for creating the same view.</p><p>In addition, SwiftUI provides a number of keywords like State, which not only allows us to write less code, but also allows us to focus more on the UI changes caused by value changes in responsive programming thinking. Since class can freely modify the value of attributes, which may bring complicated logic, in contrast, struct under the SwiftUI development of UI code is more “independent” (many of the capabilities it has also provided you, do not need to build the wheel again)</p><h4 id="4-Final-Thoughts"><a href="#4-Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="4. Final Thoughts "></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>4. Final Thoughts </font></h4><p>Because SwiftUI will only come out in 2019, compatibility for previous iOS versions is expected to be a bit of a problem. Because UIKit has been developed for many years, SwiftUI has not been as powerful as UIKit third-party libraries, but it is only a matter of time. And Apple in order to be compatible with some of the methods used, such as UIHostingController. read a lot of foreign articles, many of them developers are very clear point: SwiftUI will eventually replace UIKit, and UIKit will eventually be abandoned.</p><h4 id="5-Recommended-Learning-Resources"><a href="#5-Recommended-Learning-Resources" class="headerlink" title="5.

The type of this Body property determines the structure and content of the view. Typically, the type of Body is a specific View type.</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title class_">MyView</span>: <span class="title class_">View</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="type">Text</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>However, sometimes we create special views whose type of the Body property may not be a specific View type, but a special placeholder type indicating that the view has no actual content. In this case, we can set the type of Body to Never.</p><p>Never is a special type that denotes an impossible value or a result that will never be returned. In this context, setting the type of Body to Never means that this view has no actual content; it exists only as a container or modifier for other views.</p><p>The purpose of using Body &#x3D; Never in these view types is to indicate that they have no actual content or may not show any content depending on certain conditions. This avoids processing these views at the SwiftUI runtime, improving performance and efficiency.</p><p>Here we introduce a few SwiftUI in several common such special views, they are not directly used in SwiftUI rendering display with, they are mainly used for layout, placeholder, packaging and other roles, they have a very important role in the development of SwiftUI.</p><h4 id="2-Introduction-to-“Special”-views"><a href="#2-Introduction-to-“Special”-views" class="headerlink" title="2. Introduction to “Special” views"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>2. Introduction to “Special” views</font></h4><p><font size=3 color=#4169E1><strong>2.1 VStack, HStack, ZStack</strong></font><br>UIKit has an invisible view, UIStackView, which is used for arranging other views. In SwiftUI we can create flexible layouts using three view containers, VStack, HStack, and ZStack, which are container views that help us organize and arrange other views to create a variety of complex interfaces.</p><p>VStack: a vertical stack layout container that arranges the contained views vertically from top to bottom. This means the views will be laid out vertically in order. As follows:       </p><img src="/assets/SwiftUI/004.png" class=""> <p>HStack: Horizontal Stack Container View, arranges the contained views horizontally from left to right, and the views will be laid out horizontally in order. As follows:</p><img src="/assets/SwiftUI/005.png" class=""> <p>ZStack: cascades container views, cascading the contained views in the order they appear in the ZStack, which means that later views will override earlier ones. As follows:</p><img src="/assets/SwiftUI/006.png" class=""> <p><font size=3 color=#4169E1><strong>2.2 Spacer()</strong></font><br>Spacer is a flexible spatial view that expands along the main axis that contains the Stack layout, or on both x or y axes if it is not included in the stack.Spacer is mostly used in combination with the Stack layout trying to work together. As follows:</p><img src="/assets/SwiftUI/007.png" class="">       <img src="/assets/SwiftUI/008.png" class=""> <p>Spacer() will “fill” the space it can occupy. </p><p><font size=3 color=#4169E1><strong>2.3 Group</strong></font><br>Group is a container view in SwiftUI for combining multiple views into a logical whole. It does not apply specific layout or modifications to the views, but is only used to place multiple views in a common container.</p><img src="/assets/SwiftUI/009.png" class="">    <img src="/assets/SwiftUI/010.png" class="">    <p><font size=3 color=#4169E1><strong>2.4 NavigationView</strong></font><br>NavigationView is a container view for building navigation interfaces in SwiftUI. It provides a simple way to manage navigation stacks and navigation links, and provides the user with the ability to navigate interactively.     </p><img src="/assets/SwiftUI/011.png" class="">    <p><font size=3 color=#4169E1><strong>2.5 EmptyView</strong></font><br>EmptyView is a special view type in SwiftUI that represents an empty view without any content. It is often used as a placeholder or to hide a view under certain conditions.</p><img src="/assets/SwiftUI/012.png" class="">    <p>Although EmptyView doesn’t display anything, it’s still a valid view type and can participate in the combination and layout of views. Its presence in SwiftUI gives us the flexibility to control and manage the showing and hiding of views while keeping the code clean and consistent.</p><p><font size=3 color=#4169E1><strong>2.6 TupleView</strong></font><br>TupleView is a view type in SwiftUI for combining multiple views into a tuple view. It allows multiple views to be passed as parameters and combined as a tuple to form a view container.</p><img src="/assets/SwiftUI/013.png" class="">  <p><font size=3 color=#4169E1><strong>2.7 AnyView</strong></font><br>AnyView is a type eraser in SwiftUI that allows to encapsulate any type of view into an opaque type. In SwiftUI, each view has a specific type, but sometimes we need to manipulate views without caring about the specific type, or mix views of different types. This is where you can use AnyView to encapsulate these views and treat them as a unified type. Here is an example showing how to encapsulate and manipulate different types of views using AnyView:</p><img src="/assets/SwiftUI/014.png" class="">  <p>The above list is provided by SwiftUI, of course, we can define some special Views according to our needs.</p>]]></content>

Waterfall development"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>1. Waterfall development</font></h4><p>In the waterfall development model, there are several distinguishing features:</p><p>(1) Emphasis on documentation, with a particular focus on detailed documentation, especially the project requirements document, both for the development team and the test team is particularly important, high-quality documentation for the latter processes are critical.</p><p>(2) Longer Cycles and Larger Manpower Sizes: Development cycles are fixed and lengthy, often measured in months, and team members must follow project schedules and various specifications.</p><p>(3) Fixed requirements: requirement changes, and rework issues tend to be more costly.</p><h4 id="2-Agile-development"><a href="#2-Agile-development" class="headerlink" title="2. Agile development"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>2. Agile development</font></h4><p>It is a human-centered, iterative, step-by-step development pattern. In Agile development, it aims to deliver core functionality quickly and continuously improve it by slicing up the project into smaller parts and delivering and testing them incrementally. Instead of emphasizing perfect design and coding, it seeks to quickly release usable versions and then continuously iterate and improve. </p><p>Agile development mainly includes SCRUM, XP (Extreme Programming), Crystal Methods, FDD (Feature Driven Development) and so on. And we mainly use Scrum model in actual development.</p><p>The Scrum workflow model also needs to be built on top of well-established specifications, development tools and facilities (Git&#x2F;Jenkins&#x2F;Cocoapods&#x2F;coding specifications, etc.). It has the following main elements:</p><p>(1) Product Owner’s clarity on requirements, including prioritization, resource dependencies, etc.</p><p>(2) Developer’s task splitting, including clear prioritization, deadline, manpower allocation, etc.</p><p>(3) Daily meeting for all parties to update the status of each task (ToDo, Doing, Done) and discuss issues, etc.</p><p>(4) Tasks completed by developers can be prioritized for delivery to product owners for experience and testers for testing;</p><p>(5) Review meetings are held to summarize the problems that occurred in the middle and how to avoid them;</p><h4 id="3-Waterfall-development-vs-Agile-development"><a href="#3-Waterfall-development-vs-Agile-development" class="headerlink" title="3. Waterfall development vs Agile development"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>3. Waterfall development vs Agile development</font></h4><p>In a team, not one model dominates, which model to take depends on the situation.</p><p>For some of the more core features that require high quality (e.g., payment business), cross-team, third-party, and other collaboration scenarios where communication is not very efficient, waterfall development can still be adopted.</p><p>Agile development can be adopted when the product’s scenarios are time-sensitive and need to be validated and market captured quickly, with all the people available for quick face-to-face communication.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><font color=gray size=2><em>It will take about 5 minutes to finish reading this article.</em></font></p><p>Let’s start with a piece of SwiftUI code and its Canvas display as follows:  </p><img src="/assets/SwiftUI/000.png" class=""><p>Explain this code:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> SwiftUI</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title class_">ContentView</span>: <span class="title class_">View</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="type">Button</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">        .background(.red)</span><br><span class="line">        .frame(width: <span class="number">200</span>, height: <span class="number">200</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>(1) Create a ContentView structure and follow the View protocol. This means that ContentView is a view type and needs to implement the body property.    </p><p>(2) The body attribute returns a some View type, which means that any view that conforms to the View protocol can be returned.</p><p>(3) In the body, we have created a view that displays the text “Hello World!” using the Button view.    </p><p>(4) Several modifiers are applied to the Button view to customize its appearance, such as background to set the background color and frame to set the size to 200*200.  </p><p>How does such a few lines of code accomplish the display of a view?<br>In fact, SwiftUI combines these views and modifiers to form a complete view hierarchy based on the view hierarchy structure and modifier chaining. SwiftUI converts the view hierarchy and modifier chain from the declarative description to the underlying rendering instructions. These rendering instructions are passed to the system, which then performs the actual drawing and rendering operations that are ultimately rendered on the screen. </p><p>Below we introduce a few concepts in conjunction with the code above.</p><h4 id="1-View-Protocol"><a href="#1-View-Protocol" class="headerlink" title="1. View Protocol"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>1. View Protocol</font></h4><p>The View protocol is one of the core protocols in SwiftUI that defines the fundamentals of building user interfaces and how to use them.The source code for the View protocol is as follows:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">protocol</span> <span class="title class_">View</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">associatedtype</span> <span class="type">Body</span> : <span class="type">View</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="meta">@ViewBuilder</span> <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">Self</span>.<span class="type">Body</span> &#123; <span class="keyword">get</span> &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>As you can see from the source code, the View protocol has the following key features:</p><p>‘associatedtype Body: View’ :<br>The View protocol uses the associated type associatedtype, which means that types that follow the View protocol must specify a concrete type associated with the View. This concrete type is named Body and must also conform to the View protocol.</p><p>‘var body: Self.Body { get }’ :<br>The View protocol requires that followers must provide a computed property named body. This property returns a view type that is the previously defined association type Body.</p><p>The View protocol works by returning a specific view hierarchy via the body property. This view hierarchy can contain other views or components to form a complex user interface, and SwiftUI renders the final user interface based on this view hierarchy.</p><h4 id="2-some-View"><a href="#2-some-View" class="headerlink" title="2. some View"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>2. some View</font></h4><p>Using ‘some View’ as a return type means that the view can return any type that conforms to the View protocol. This syntax is called opaque return type, a feature that allows the compiler to infer the type of view returned without requiring the developer to explicitly specify it. It means that “an object conforms to the View protocol, but we do not care whether it is a Button or Text, as long as the compiler knows on the line”.</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> SwiftUI</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title class_">ContentView</span>: <span class="title class_">View</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="type">Button</span> &#123; <span class="comment">//This is not a View but a Button.</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="type">Button</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">        .background(.red)</span><br><span class="line">        .frame(width: <span class="number">200</span>, height: <span class="number">200</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The effect of the above code is the same, only the lack of flexibility, each time you need to figure out what type of specific return in the body, too tired, in fact, to the compiler on the line.         </p><p>‘some’ is a special generic type placeholder in Swift that supports more complex combinations and reuse of multiple view types, making SwiftUI code more flexible and concise and reducing the possibility of type errors, which is also a reflection of SwiftUI’s polymorphism.</p><h4 id="3-Modifier"><a href="#3-Modifier" class="headerlink" title="3. Modifier"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>3.

For example, after modifier A is modified, it forms an object, and after it is modified by modifier B, it becomes another object.</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="type">Button</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="built_in">type</span>(of: <span class="keyword">self</span>.body))</span><br><span class="line">&#125;    </span><br><span class="line">.background(.red)</span><br><span class="line">.frame(width: <span class="number">200</span>, height: <span class="number">200</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>With type you can print the exact type of a value as follows:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="type">ModifiedContent</span>&lt;<span class="type">ModifiedContent</span>&lt;<span class="type">Button</span>&lt;<span class="type">Text</span>&gt;, _BackgroundStyleModifier&lt;<span class="type">Color</span>&gt;&gt;, _FrameLayout<span class="operator">&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It first generates a Button with text and background color via ‘ModifiedContent&lt;Button<Text>, _BackgroundStyleModifier<Color>‘.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><font color=gray size=2><em>It will take about 3 minutes to finish reading this article.</em></font></p><p>Just as we struggled with whether or not to embrace Swift, are many people today struggling with whether or not to embrace SwiftUI. Then I can tell you very clearly that if you choose to embrace Swift, then SwiftUI is a hurdle you won’t be able to get past sooner or later! Take my advice, it’s not too late to embrace SwiftUI, you’ll find more and more hiring JD’s asking for SwiftUI. I’ve also been learning SwiftUI on my own lately, and I’m going to be writing a series of posts about SwiftUI, so let’s start with this one on SwiftUI vs UIKit and why we’re going to go with SwiftUI.</p><h4 id="1-UIKit"><a href="#1-UIKit" class="headerlink" title="1. UIKit"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>1. UIKit</font></h4><p>UIKit was publicly released in 2008 and is built on the object-oriented Objective-C language. In UIKit, all views inherit from a class called UIView, which has a very large number of properties and methods-such as background, layout, layers for rendering, and so on-there are almost 200 properties, and every UIView and subclass of UIView, whether you want it or not, will have Every UIView and subclass of UIView will have these properties whether you want them or not. </p><p>For example, there is a special UIStackView in UIKit, which is a view type that will not be rendered for the design intent of making layouts simpler. But because of the inheritance mechanism, even though it doesn’t render, it has those various unused properties including background color. </p><p>So, in UIKit, when we draw a UI that contains a series of labels&#x2F;buttons, etc., it’s a stack of “big” and “heavy” Views that contain more than 200 attributes.</p><h4 id="2-SwiftUI"><a href="#2-SwiftUI" class="headerlink" title="2. SwiftUI"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>2. SwiftUI</font></h4><p>Born in 2019, SwiftUI is a modern framework for building user interfaces introduced by Apple. As new devices evolve in terms of processing power, graphics performance, and other technical features, SwiftUI takes full advantage of these new hardware and technical capabilities, optimizing and tuning the underlying implementation so that apps running on new devices can render interfaces, handle user interactions, and deliver smoother animations and effects more efficiently.</p><p>SwiftUI is based on responsive programming approach to UI development, all the views are fine-grained structure struct, compared struct and class can be known, Swift is very much advocate the use of struct, the specific why will not expand.  In SwiftUI, each view is a lightweight struct structure, which abandons UIKit’s inheritance approach and uses protocols to contain the few properties and modifiers needed. All in all, SwiftUI is much more performant and faster than UIKit, with less overhead for creating the same view.</p><p>In addition, SwiftUI provides a number of keywords like State, which not only allows us to write less code, but also allows us to focus more on the UI changes caused by value changes in responsive programming thinking. Since class can freely modify the value of attributes, which may bring complicated logic, in contrast, struct under the SwiftUI development of UI code is more “independent” (many of the capabilities it has also provided you, do not need to build the wheel again)</p><h4 id="3-Final-Thoughts"><a href="#3-Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="3. Final Thoughts "></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>3. Final Thoughts </font></h4><p>Because SwiftUI will only come out in 2019, compatibility for previous iOS versions is expected to be a bit of a problem. Because UIKit has been developed for many years, SwiftUI has not been as powerful as UIKit third-party libraries, but it is only a matter of time. And Apple in order to be compatible with some of the methods used, such as UIHostingController. read a lot of foreign articles, many of them developers are very clear point: SwiftUI will eventually replace UIKit, and UIKit will eventually be abandoned.</p><h4 id="4-Recommended-Learning-Resources"><a href="#4-Recommended-Learning-Resources" class="headerlink" title="4.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><font color=gray size=2><em>It will take about 5 minutes to finish reading this article.</em></font></p><h4 id="1-Background"><a href="#1-Background" class="headerlink" title="1. Background"></a><font size=4 color=#4169E1>1. Background</font></h4><p>This is really one of the issues that impressed me. I’m recording it here specifically because I find it quite fascinating.   </p><p>At that time I was a leader of iOS team based on Oversea business at Meituan. The business was brand new, I was one of the few guys who were familiar all Oversea business. One day, Our data engineer came to me, and told me that the location data of our business had a high lost rate to 30%, even to 50% in some special areas. According to past experience, it may be normal for this loss rate to be between 10% and 15%, so it was too high.</p><p>As we all kown, without the correct location information(City or region information), we could not offer different  business data to the accurate areas we wanted. Soon I realized  it was a serious problem for our business, and I reported it to our technical boss. We decided that until the problem was resolved, the users that lost location information could only read the default H5 page we offered.</p><h4 id="2-Investigation-process"><a href="#2-Investigation-process" class="headerlink" title="2. Investigation process"></a><font size=4 color=#4169E1>2. Investigation process</font></h4><p>Then I began to investigate the issue and tried to optimize it. Later, I gradually discovered that the issues involved in this process are very complicated, involving many links and requiring a lot of cross-team cooperation.</p><p>The process of getting location data in iOS is as follows:   </p><p>(1) iOS gets the longitude and latitude by calling the system callback function in CLLocationManagerDelegate.</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="operator">-</span> (void)locationManager:(<span class="type">CLLocationManager</span> <span class="operator">*</span>)manager didUpdateLocations:(<span class="type">NSArray</span> <span class="operator">*</span>)locations &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="type">CLLocation</span> <span class="operator">*</span>location <span class="operator">=</span> [locations firstObject]; </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="type">CLLocationCoordinate2D</span> coordinate <span class="operator">=</span> location.coordinate; </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="type">NSLog</span>(@<span class="string">&quot;Longitude: %f, Latitude: %f&quot;</span>,coordinate.longitude,coordinate.latitude);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>At this step, although there could have been failures with a rate of 5% more or less, what we could do was limited, not only because it was a system-level method, but more importantly, this was the code that existed in the basic library. Any modification to it would have affected the entire company’s business.</p><p>(2) After getting the latitude and longitude, we used them and some other information (IP address, etc.) to request a back-end interface( we can call it requestPosition), which will return the corresponding location information, which is a basic public interface for all the company’s business.</p><p>Then by querying the interface logs and the database logs of other businesses, I found that the failure rate of this interface for overseas business was very high, but the failure rate for domestic business was normal. I don’t know why. After all, all businesses use the same interface. </p><p>But even though I didn’t know why, I pushed for something: to create the interface in a way that in overseas business scenarios, if it failed to acquire location information, it would trigger a retry mechanism, meaning that if the first attempt failed, the subsequent attempt would be made up to 2 times until it succeeded(The actual logic may be more complex.).</p><p>After doing this optimization, I again verified the location information data for the business and found that the data had improved, but the improvement was limited, about 20% to 25% from the original average of 30% to 40%.</p><p>(3) I escalated the issue after that because I felt that it might be beyond our capabilities on the mobile side, and I organized multiple meetings with multiple server-side teams to discuss the issue.  </p><p>In the discussion with the server side I found:<br>Because the company’s network services are basically customized http protocol, take the network long connection, with the help of strong domestic server resources, domestic users benefit from this way, the network’s end-to-end success rate is very high (long connection that is, through the heartbeat message way to keep alive).</p><p>However, due to the lack of sufficient server resources in foreign countries, coupled with the network conditions in some foreign regions were not very good, at this time, the end-to-end success rate of the network long connection was very low, and may be even lower than the short link method. We originally wanted to change the overseas business network request to short connection, but after discussion, we felt that this is not a fundamental solution. </p><p>Later, I learned that through the efforts of our big boss, we were able to help our overseas business deploy a dedicated server resource in Hong Kong to support the overseas business. Later this data was optimized and finally reached the ideal zone.</p><p>So far, this problem was solved.</p><h4 id="3-Review-and-summary"><a href="#3-Review-and-summary" class="headerlink" title="3. Review and summary"></a><font size=4 color=#4169E1>3. Review and summary</font></h4><p>In this process, I had to constantly review other teams’ code, and communicated with the basic service team many times on how to optimize the code.  </p><p>I needed to apply permissions to various databases and learned to write various SQL languages to query data. Query server-side logs, query other business data repeatedly for comparison. </p><p>During this period, I also needed to discuss and communicate with multiple server teams and multiple data teams.</p><p>Although this work could be beyond the ability and responsibility of an iOS developer, and the process was full of challenges, But in retrospect, I still benefited a lot from it and learned a lot of knowledge beyond iOS.</p>]]></content>

In Objective-C, an object can be an instance or a class. When an object is created, it is allocated to memory and initialized to zero. If it is not initialized to another value, the object pointer has a value of nil.</p><p>In Objective-C, sending a message to a nil object is valid because the message does not result in any operation. This is because Objective-C messaging is implemented through method calls that send messages to objects, not through the methods of the objects themselves. So when the object is nil, calling the object’s methods has no effect because it is essentially a null pointer.</p><p>Here’s an example showing the use of nil in Objective-C:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">NSString *str = nil;</span><br><span class="line">NSLog(@&quot;The value of str is: %@&quot;, str);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output results:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">The value of str is: (null)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p> <strong>1.2 Implementation Principle</strong><br>In terms of the underlying implementation, nil in Objective-C is actually a predefined macro for a null object pointer. In Objective-C, all objects are accessed via pointers, and a nil is actually a pointer with a value of zero. Thus, when an object is assigned a value of nil, it is actually given a pointer with a value of 0, indicating that the object does not exist.</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">#define nil __DARWIN_NULL</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>‘__DARWIN_NULL’ is a null pointer constant pointing to a null address, defined in &lt;stddef.h&gt; with the following code:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">#define __DARWIN_NULL ((void *)0)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Thus, in Objective-C, when we use nil, we are actually using a null pointer constant to a null address for a null object pointer.</p><h4 id="2-nil-in-Swift"><a href="#2-nil-in-Swift" class="headerlink" title="2. nil in Swift"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>2. nil in Swift</font></h4><p><strong>2.1 The Concept</strong><br>In Swift, nil is not a pointer to an empty object. It represents a special type that lacks a value, which is not limited to objects. In Swift, you can use nil to represent any type of value, including basic data types (such as Int, Double, etc.) as well as object types.</p><p>nil in Swift is used for optional types. If a variable or constant is declared as an optional type, it can either contain a value or be nil. if an attempt is made to forcibly unwrap (i.e., get the actual value of) a variable or constant of an optional type, and the variable or constant currently has the value of nil, the program will crash.</p><p>Here’s an example showing the use of nil in Swift:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> str: <span class="type">String</span>? <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="literal">nil</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;The value of str is: <span class="subst">\(str)</span>&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output results:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="type">The</span> value of str <span class="keyword">is</span>: <span class="literal">nil</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The above code will report an error if it is changed to the following:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> str: <span class="type">String</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="literal">nil</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Or</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> str <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="literal">nil</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The error messages are as follows:   </p><img src="/assets/iOS/Others/001.png" class="">    <p>Or   </p><img src="/assets/iOS/Others/002.png" class=""><p>That’s because in Swift, the types of variables and constants must be explicitly specified at declaration time. When we declare a variable or constant and initialize it to nil, the Swift compiler can’t determine the type of the variable or constant because nil can represent a missing value of many types. Therefore, we need to tell the compiler the type of the variable or constant by way of a type annotation or type inference.</p><p>‘var str: String &#x3D; nil ‘ declares a variable str of type String and initializes it to nil, but the Swift compiler is not able to determine the type of the variable because nil can represent the missing value of multiple types. As a result, the compiler reports an error, suggesting that we need to provide a Contextual Type or an optional type for it.</p><p><strong>2.2 Implementation Principle</strong>   </p><p>In Swift, all types can use optional types to represent the case of missing values. An optional type is actually an enumerated type that has two possible values: a value and no value. When an optional type has a value of nil, it is actually a special enum member that indicates that the value is missing.</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">enum</span> <span class="title class_">Optional</span>&lt;<span class="title class_">T</span>&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">case</span> none</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">case</span> <span class="keyword">some</span>(<span class="type">T</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> str: <span class="type">String</span>? <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">&quot;hello&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">str <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="literal">nil</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">let</span> value <span class="operator">=</span> str &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;The value of str is: <span class="subst">\(value)</span>&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125; <span class="keyword">else</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">&quot;The value of str is nil&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output results</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="type">The</span> value of str <span class="keyword">is</span> <span class="literal">nil</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h4 id="3-Conclusion"><a href="#3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Conclusion"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>3. Conclusion</font></h4><p>In Objective-C, nil represents a pointer to a null object, which is used to indicate that the object does not exist. In Swift, nil represents a missing value and can be used to represent any type of value. In terms of the underlying implementation, nil in Objective-C is a predefined macro that represents a pointer to a null object, while nil in Swift is a special type that represents the case of an optional type (enumerated type) that is missing a value. In practice, developers need to choose the appropriate language and data type to indicate the presence or absence of a value according to different situations to ensure the correctness and stability of the program.</p>]]></content>

Therefore, the client will exit.</p><p><strong>Sample code：</strong>  </p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">SocketManager</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">var</span> inputStream: <span class="type">InputStream</span>?</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">var</span> outputStream: <span class="type">OutputStream</span>?</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">let</span> host: <span class="type">String</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">&quot;localhost&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">let</span> port: <span class="type">Int</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="number">12345</span></span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title function_">connect</span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="type">Stream</span>.getStreamsToHost(withName: host, port: port, inputStream: <span class="operator">&amp;</span>inputStream, outputStream: <span class="operator">&amp;</span>outputStream)</span><br><span class="line">        </span><br><span class="line">        inputStream<span class="operator">?</span>.open()</span><br><span class="line">        outputStream<span class="operator">?</span>.open()</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title function_">disconnect</span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        inputStream<span class="operator">?</span>.close()</span><br><span class="line">        outputStream<span class="operator">?</span>.close()</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;

Caused by Watch Dog Timeout </font></h4><p><strong>Problem analysis：</strong><br>Watchdog Timeout is a monitoring mechanism built into the iOS system that checks whether the code executed by the application in the main thread exceeds the specified time. If it times out, the system automatically terminates the execution of the application to avoid a poor user experience caused by application freezes.</p><p>Watchdog Timeout typically occurs during time-consuming operations such as network requests, IO operations, and large data processing. If these time-consuming operations are not handled correctly, it is easy to trigger Watchdog Timeout, leading to application crashes.</p><p><strong>Sample code：</strong><br>For example, executing the following code in the main thread may trigger a Watchdog timeout:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title function_">doHeavyWork</span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="number">1</span><span class="operator">...</span><span class="number">1000000000</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// execute a large number of loop operations</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><strong>Recommended solution:：</strong><br>First, put time-consuming operations in a separate thread to avoid occupying the main thread for too long, thereby avoiding the occurrence of Watchdog Timeout. You can use GCD or NSOperationQueue to implement this.</p><p>Second, use an asynchronous method to execute time-consuming operations and use an appropriate queue to manage the execution. For example, use DispatchQueue.global() to create a global queue, and then use the async method to asynchronously execute tasks. In addition, you can also use NSOperationQueue to manage tasks.         </p><p>Third, use a timer or RunLoop to periodically execute time-consuming operations, and check whether the time exceeds the Watchdog Timeout setting before execution. If it times out, stop executing and put the task on hold until the next execution cycle.  </p><p>Fourth, if time-consuming operations must be performed in the main thread, you can use NSRunLoop to control the execution time and periodically call the run method to ensure that the Watchdog Timeout setting is not exceeded.</p><h4 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a><font size=3 color=gray><em>Reference</em></font></h4><p>[1] <a href="https://juejin.cn/post/6844903775203753997">https://juejin.cn/post/6844903775203753997</a><br>[2] <a href="https://juejin.cn/post/6978014329333350430">https://juejin.cn/post/6978014329333350430</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><font color=gray size=2><em>It will take about 3 minutes to finish reading this article.</em></font></p><p>Questions about Memory leak (memory leak), if the interview was asked this question and such questions, mainly related to the following 3 aspects.</p><ul><li>What are the common scenarios of memory leaks, and list a few common examples?</li><li>How to locate and solve memory leaks that actually occur during development?</li><li>How to avoid memory leaks in development and what are the methods?</li></ul><p>Below we summarize these 3 aspects respectively.</p><h4 id="Common-scenarios-for-Memory-Leak"><a href="#Common-scenarios-for-Memory-Leak" class="headerlink" title=" Common scenarios for Memory Leak"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1> Common scenarios for Memory Leak</font></h4><p><strong>1. Circular References</strong><br>Under the ARC mechanism, circular references are a major cause of memory leaks, and it is also divided into many specific scenarios, such as</p><ul><li>Circular references between two class objects.</li><li>Circular reference problems in Blocks (including GCD or other system Blocks, etc.).</li><li>Circular reference problem in Timer. </li><li>Circular reference problem brought by delegate.</li><li>Scenarios such as property observation and listening classes.</li></ul><p><strong>2. improper object life cycle management</strong><br>This kind needs to be analyzed in the context of actual business problems, e.g.</p><ul><li>Static fields or other global objects lead to improper holding causing memory leaks.</li><li>The reference relationship of collection classes, etc. is improper or not released in time, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3. untimely release of objects</strong><br>Some objects require manual memory release, such as the Core Foundation (CF) and Core Graphics (CG) framework objects. If these objects are not released in time, it may lead to memory leaks.   </p><p><strong>4. Untimely closure or release of resources</strong><br>Untimely closure (or failure to release) of resource classes is also a common memory leak scenario, for example</p><ul><li>The file is opened (FileHandle) and not closed in time.</li><li>The URLSession object of a network request is not released in time.</li></ul><h4 id="How-to-locate-and-solve-the-memory-leak"><a href="#How-to-locate-and-solve-the-memory-leak" class="headerlink" title=" How to locate and solve the memory leak"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1> How to locate and solve the memory leak</font></h4><p>In fact, after finding the problem, it is basically easy to solve, for example:</p><p>Circular reference means to break the cycle by using weak; If the life cycle of the object is improper, the holder can be changed or the code needs to be redesigned; CF or CG objects need to be released manually; The occupation of resource class also needs to be released manually in time.</p><p>But the main problem is how to find the leaked code.</p><p><strong><strong><font size=3>1. Manual debugging method</font></strong>  </strong></p><p>When we realize that there is a leak, there are usually obvious symptoms, such as VC Pop failure.</p><p>If we are familiar with the code, generally, I believe many people will directly find the code for manual debugging. Common means include:</p><ul><li>Override dealloc or deinit methods</li></ul><p>We can try to add a log to the dealloc or deinit method breakpoint of some classes. If there is no expected execution, it is a suspected leak point.</p><ul><li>Manually check reference count</li></ul><p>Manually checking the reference count of an object can help us find out whether there is a memory leak caused by a reference count error. We can manually check the reference count of an object using the retentCount property in Objective-C or Swift.</p><ul><li>Write some extra test code</li></ul><p>If the memory leak point is relatively obscure, it can be reproduced by writing code of some test cases, such as 9999 consecutive cycles to expand the problem and cause memory exhaustion and crash, and then locate the code according to the stack, which is also a common method to locate probabilistic crashes;</p><ul><li>One-by-one ranking method</li></ul><p>Comment out the code of the problem one by one until the problem point is found. Similar methods are often used to troubleshoot the crash problem during development. Although it looks very low, it is very effective.</p><p><strong><strong><font size=3>2. Tools</font></strong>  </strong></p><p>There are many ways to use this, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Instruments toolbox, which uses Leaks tool or memory debugger Analyze to analyze;</p></li><li><p>The Memory Graph in Xcode Memory Debugger can help us analyze the memory reference relationship of objects and find circular references and memory leaks.</p></li><li><p>Third-party detection tools, such as MLeaksFinder, FBRetainCycleDetector, LeakDetector, HeapInspector, etc.</p></li><li><p>Static analysis tools, such as Clang static analyzer, Infer, OCLint, SwiftLint and other tools. These tools generally find some memory leak code incidentally, which can give us some tips or warnings.</p></li></ul><h4 id="How-to-avoid-Memory-Leak"><a href="#How-to-avoid-Memory-Leak" class="headerlink" title="How to avoid Memory Leak?"></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1>How to avoid Memory Leak?</font></h4><p>In actual development, it is unlikely that writing a piece of code to run the tools of Instrument immediately, even some MLeaksFinder these often false alarm tools are too annoying to close directly.<br>Then How can we avoid and minimize the generation of problem code?</p><p>First, there should be some risk awareness. For example, Timer since the choice of it, you should know that its biggest risk is easy to cause memory problems. Know by heart some scenarios that can easily lead to leaks. Also, for example, be careful with global variables or single instances, etc.</p><p>Second, get into some habits. For example, after writing a piece of code or receiving a piece of code, make sure the object is expected to be released at the dealloc or deinit breakpoint. Also for example, Swift as far as possible to take the value type, rather than reference types; development after self-test, some memory detection tools are turned on as an aid to detection.</p><p>Third, good system design. Some business scenarios are easy to generate leakage, for example, once I participated in the development of a live business, the room VC and the room’s only data model object dataModel is easy to refer to each other, because the dataModel carries a lot of business information, the business is extremely dependent on the dataModel, the object is therefore also passed very deep and wide, and a circular reference occurs easily. For this kind of improper design at the beginning, only a patch can be fixed later (maintain a dataModel weak reference collection, each time you use the id to query and get the corresponding room dataModel object, the business only needs to maintain an id String object or a dictionary object to store the least information). Similar business scenarios are commodity detail pages and so on.</p><p>Fourth, the regular project code to do a “physical examination”, the general project volume is larger, this is very necessary, run the Instrumentation or Memory Graph, almost every time there are gains.</p>]]></content>

It is somewhat similar to struct. It is very flexible and has a wide range of uses. Enumeration in Swift has the following characteristics:  </p><blockquote><ul><li>It is of value type.</li><li>It can conform to protocols to provide standard functionality.</li><li>It can be extended to expand their functionality beyond their original implementation.</li><li>It can also define initializers to provide an initial case value and define common functions and properties(computed properties).   </li><li>It supports recursion.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Enumerations in Swift are first-class types in their own right. They adopt many features traditionally supported only by classes.</p><h4 id="2-Associated-Values-and-Raw-Values"><a href="#2-Associated-Values-and-Raw-Values" class="headerlink" title=" 2.

Raw values are set to prepopulate values when you first define the enumeration in your code, like the three ASCII codes above. The raw value for a particular enumeration case is always the same.

The value of “speed” is copied, but the property “increaseSpeed” of “myNewCar” (myNewCar.increaseSpeed?()) holds a reference to the “increaseSpeed” of “myCar” with the “speed” of “myCar” in the captured environment. So, the “increaseSpeed” of “myCar” is invoked.<br>So what do we do now?<br>The straight forward solution is, avoid using closures in value types or we should change the struct to a class. If you have to use them, you should be very careful with it, or else it might lead to unexpected results. Regarding the retain cycle, the only way to break them is to set the variables “myCar” and “myNewCar” to nil manually. It doesn’t sound ideal, but there is no other way. </p><h4 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a><font size=3 color=gray><em>Reference</em></font></h4><p>[1] <a href="https://ohmyswift.com/blog/2020/01/10/why-should-we-avoid-using-closures-in-swift-structs/">Why should we avoid using closures in Swift structs?</a><br>[2] <a href="https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1602230">为什么要避免在结构体中使用闭包？</a>   </p>]]></content>

Both can:</p><blockquote><ol><li>Property, method and initializers can both be defined.  </li><li>Both support protocol and extension.</li></ol></blockquote><p>They have diferent capabilities that:</p><blockquote><ol><li>Class is the reference type; Struct is a value type.</li><li>Class supports inheritance; Struct does not support inheritance.</li><li>The mutating keyword is not required to modify the attribute of the method declared by class; struct needs.</li><li>The class does not provide a default memberwise initializer; Struct provides the default memberwise initializer.</li><li>Class supports reference counting; Struct is not supported.</li><li>Class supports Type casting; Struct is not supported.</li><li>Class supports Deinitializers; Struct is not supported.</li></ol></blockquote><p><font size=2 color=#4169E1>1.2 Identity Operators.</font><br>It can sometimes be useful to find out whether two constants or variables refer to exactly the same instance of a class. To enable this, Swift provides two identity operators:</p><blockquote><p>Identical to (&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;)<br>Not identical to (!&#x3D;&#x3D;)  </p></blockquote><p>Use these operators to check whether two constants or variables refer to the same single instance.</p><p>By default, custom classes and structures don’t have an implementation of the equivalence operators, known as the equal to operator (&#x3D;&#x3D;) and not equal to operator (!&#x3D;). You usually implement the &#x3D;&#x3D; operator, and use the standard library’s default implementation of the !&#x3D; operator that negates the result of the &#x3D;&#x3D; operator.

Force unwrapping </font></h4><p>Forced unwrapping of optional types means that when we are sure that an optional type must have a value, we can use the exclamation mark ! to force parsing of it and thus get the value in it. If we use forced parsing on an optional type that has no value, a runtime error will be triggered. Therefore, when using forced parsing, we must make sure that the optional type does have a value.</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> possibleString: <span class="type">String</span>? <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">&quot;An optional string.&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> forcedString: <span class="type">String</span> <span class="operator">=</span> possibleString<span class="operator">!</span> <span class="comment">// Need exclamation mark to get value</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h4 id="2-Implicitly-Unwrapped-Optionals"><a href="#2-Implicitly-Unwrapped-Optionals" class="headerlink" title=" 2.

Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals </font></h4><p>An implicitly Unwrapped Optionals type is a special kind of optional type that is declared with the exclamation mark ! flag to indicate that this optional type can be implicitly treated as a non-optional type for subsequent use, without the need to force resolution each time. At declaration time, we can declare an optional type as an implicitly resolved optional type, which will throw an error at runtime if the variable or constant is not initialized to a non-nil value at the time of use.</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> assumedString2: <span class="type">String</span>! <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">&quot;123&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> possibleString2: <span class="type">String</span>? <span class="operator">=</span> assumedString2</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> implicitString2: <span class="type">String</span> <span class="operator">=</span> assumedString2  <span class="comment">//No exclamation point needed</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> assumedString1: <span class="type">String</span>! <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="literal">nil</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> possibleString1: <span class="type">String</span>? <span class="operator">=</span> assumedString1</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> implicitString1: <span class="type">String</span> <span class="operator">=</span> assumedString1  <span class="comment">// Report Error</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So, implicitly unwrapped optionals type is special optionals type that can be used to get the value in it directly using the variable name, without having to force unwrapping every time.<br>We can do these as follows:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> assumedString <span class="operator">!=</span> <span class="literal">nil</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(assumedString<span class="operator">!</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Prints &quot;An implicitly unwrapped optional string.&quot;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>You can also use an implicitly unwrapped optional with optional binding, to check and unwrap its value in a single statement:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">let</span> definiteString <span class="operator">=</span> assumedString &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(definiteString)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Prints &quot;An implicitly unwrapped optional string.&quot;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>]]></content>

Handlings of Objective-C "></a><font size=3 color=#4169E1> 1. Handlings of Objective-C </font></h4><p>In Objective-C, we often write code like this:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="type">NSError</span> <span class="operator">*</span>error;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="type">BOOL</span> success <span class="operator">=</span> [data writeToFile: path options: options error: <span class="operator">&amp;</span>error];</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>(error) &#123;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// something happens</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>That is a very good method to handle possible errors. However we often simply this code like this:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[data writeToFile: path options: options error: <span class="literal">nil</span>];</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We set varaible error to nil, Maybe we don’t care about this error when we are developing. However this method can report errors. For example, if the space of the device’s disk is full, you will write unsuccessfully, and this error can’t not be found easily becase of our laziness.</p><h4 id="2-Handlings-of-Swift"><a href="#2-Handlings-of-Swift" class="headerlink" title=" 2.
